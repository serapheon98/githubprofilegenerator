# githubprofilegenerator
A simple application, that can quickly fetch details of a github profile using AJAX. Github has a really easy to use API that can return JSON content that was used in the application.
You can easily get your github profile's JSON object by visiting (https://api.github.com/users/serapheon98). Just replace the username with yours. :)
